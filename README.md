# pwd_generator
A simple python program to generate strong passwords.
This program generates a random password using a combination of letters (both upper- and lower-case), digits, and punctuation characters.
The length of the password can be adjusted by passing an argument to the “generate_password” function.
By default, the length is set to 16 characters, which is considered to be a secure length for a password.
